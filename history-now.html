						<h3>Alpinist club "LETI" before 1990:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>1970, August:</strong>
							Few known teams of the Leningrad student society "Burevestnik" became the USSR Champion after passing the North Face of the Peak of Marx (SW Pamir, 6726 meters above sea level). Prior to this, the steep two-kilometer wall of the peak of Marx was not conquered and was considered impassable. The ascent took two weeks. It was attended by 8 people, among them five - from LETI. The captain of the team was Fedor Zhitenev, at that time - senior engineer of the Institute of Physics, Leningrad State University, trainer of the mountaineering section of LETI.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1971, summer:</strong>
							The team of the Leningrad "Burevestnik" again became the Champion of the country, having passed through the wall of the summit of Bodkhon (Fan Mountains, Pamir-Alai). The ascent lasted 11 days, it was attended by 5 people: Fedor Zhitenev (head), Yuri Gorenchuk, Alexander Lipchinsky, Yuri Logachev and Alexander Zayonchkovsky. All except Logachev - from LETI and participants of the ascent to the peak of Marx.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1972, summer:</strong>
							On Tien Shan, again podtschy F. Zhitenev, was climbed to the peak of the Russian Geographical Society, occupied in the USSR Championship third place.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1973-76:</strong>
							The number of colleges, in addition to the head of the departments, including students and graduates. Mountaineering has become an equal sport at the Department of Physical Education LETI. On the territory of the institute boiler house, we first mastered the "LETI wall" for training, and then the brick "LETI pipe".
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1977, summer:</strong>
							After a five-year hiatus, the team of the Leningrad "Burevestnik" again became the country's champion, having passed the Northern wall "5200" (Guamish, Pamir-Alai). The ascent lasted seven days. A memorable photograph was taken at the top, which captured all of its participants: Mikhail Zahozhego (a native of the Mining Institute, then head of the sports department of LETI, the head coach of the Burevestnik team), Sergei Larionov (LETI), Yuri Gorenchuk (captain of the team, Leningrad State University) , Leonid Troshchinenko (Voenmeh), Yuri Logachev (LSU), Alexander Lipchinsky (LETI), Lev Sapozhkov (LETI) and Georgy Shchedrin (Voenmeh). After thirteen years out of eight participants of this ascent, only two remained alive: M. Zaichiy and S. Larionov.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1978, August:</strong>
							During the second attempt to pass the "Stormy Petrel" of the North Face of the Peak of Marx, Yuri Logachev was killed. When two thirds of the wall had already been passed, a rockfall fell from above and interrupted his safety ropes. It fell down about 1.5 kilometers.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1979:</strong>
							Leonid Troshchinenko and Georgy Shchedrin moved from Voenmech to the LETI section.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1980, January 31:</strong>
							Four beginning climbers LETI (including Sergei Larionov's half-brother - Andrey) and two LITMO students, led by Alexander Lipchinsky, left for a one-day training ascent to the Chkalov peak (Tuyuk-su, Tien-Shan) and did not return. Their bodies were found only the next day. Literally on the very first meters of the route they "cut" the snow slope and the huge snowy "board" that came down from above pulled everyone down and buried under them. After the tragedy, Mikhail Zakhozhy had to leave the faculty of physical education LETI. Leonid Troshchinenko was invited to take his place. At the same time, he became the third captain of the team "Burevestnik", and Yuri Gorenchuk - her senior coach. From that moment the era of Troshchinenko came to LETI. Leonid Troshchinenko, who by the summer of 1980 had already passed three of the four seven-thousanders of the Soviet Union, with other terms, became a candidate for the first Soviet Himalayan expedition to Everest, and as a result of two-year selections (by that time he was already forty years old) entered the the basic structure, having appeared one of three Leningraders who have got on expedition. However, shortly before its inception (in December 1981 - ed.), The medical institute, in which future "Himalayans" were examined, suddenly forbade him to climb even to the height of the base camp, referring to extraneous noises found in his heart . The ban was also against Muscovite Eduard Myslovsky, but he was upheld and took charge of the leadership of the expedition.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1982, spring:</strong>
							Leonid Troshchinenko went to the Himalayas as the head of the household. His duties included, as well, the maintenance of the way through the Khumbu icefall. Summer: After the return of Leonid Troshchinenko from the Himalayas, the Burevestnik team, under his direction, passed the North Face of the Aksu Peak (Pamir-Alai), once again becoming the winner of the national championship. However, soon, the State Committee for Sports received a complaint about the violation of the rules of the competition by the team, after reviewing which, he deprived participants of the ascent of medals and the right to speak at the national championships for several years.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1983, summer:</strong> 
								A third attempt was made to pass the North Wall of Marx Peak. Because of the bad weather, it was unsuccessful, and all the participants of the ascent descended.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1984, summer:</strong>
							 Due to the ban on participation in competitions, the LETI leadership has reoriented to work in international alpine camps engaged in providing and escorting foreign climbing groups, having spent the summer season in the international alpiger Cheget (the Caucasus). July 17: Nineteen-year-old Borya Shimanel died in the Teke-Tor (Ala-Archa, Tien-Shan) summit, who was engaged in the LETI section for slightly more than two years.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1985, January 25:</strong>
							Yuri Gorenchuk, a man in Leningrad mountaineering legendary and revered, committed suicide by opening his veins. March: LETI team made one of the first (in the history of Soviet mountain climbing) winter ascents of the highest (sixth) difficulty category, having risen on Krumkol (Bezengi, the most severe region of the Caucasus). April 25: Lev Sapozhkov, participant of the ascent to "5200" (Guamish), and many others died. Summer: The older generation of LETI, led by Leonid Troshchinenko, firmly established itself in the international alpiger "Pamir" under the peak of Lenin. For several years of work, they proceeded this 7,000 meters along and across.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1986, winter:</strong>
							 In January, the State Committee of Sport decided to undertake the first in the history of Soviet mountaineering winter ascent to the seven thousandths. The highest point of the country was chosen as the object - the peak of Communism. For this purpose, a conditional national team of the USSR was equipped, similar to the Himalayan team. In parallel, Leonid Troshchinenko - organized the ascent to another 7,000-meter peak - Yevhen Korzhenevskaya peak, in which members of the Leningrad Burevestnik team and the LETI section took part. As a result, both assaults ended in reaching the peaks, but two people were killed while descending from the peak of Communism, and several more, including a participant in the Everest expedition Vladimir Shopin, received extremely heavy frostbite. At the peak of Korzhenevskaya everything went well.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1987, spring:</strong>
							Selection began for the second Soviet Himalayan expedition, scheduled for the spring of 89, whose goal was to consistently pass all the peaks of the eight-thousand-strong Kanchenjunga. In this selection, five LETI students participated. Leonid Troshchinenko went to work at the film studio "Lennauchfilm", where he began to manage high-altitude shooting. Training for high-altitude cinematographers was also attended by a few more people. According to the results of the selection, Sergey Arsentiev ("Mafia") and Mikhail Mozhaev got to the expedition from the LETI. Leonid Troshchinenko and Alexander Glushkovsky went to the Himalayas as part of the film group.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1988:</strong>
							In the gymnasium of the Institute, the first wooden shields appeared in the city for working out rock climbing techniques. Mountaineering became the main sport in LETI.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1989, April: </strong>
							The expedition to Kanchenjunga began. Sergei Arsentiev and Mikhail Mozhaev climbed several peaks in the composition of assault teams. Alexander Glushkovsky and Leonid Troshchinenko - to the main, as cinematographers (Troshchinenko - at the age of 46, six years after the doctors banned his participation in climbing Mount Everest). <br><strong>summer: </strong> Leonid Troshchinenko left Lennauchfilm and returned to LETI, starting the preparation of an independent LETI expedition to the Himalayan eight-thousandth Cho-Oyu ("The Goddess of Turquoise"), scheduled for autumn of the year. For the first time in the history of Soviet mountaineering, the ascent to the Himalayan eight-thousand-meter was going to be done by the institute team. Under the opportunity to leave for the Himalayas, several people from other Leningrad sections joined them. Autumn: Sergei Arsentiev climbed Mount Everest from China, as part of the US-Soviet-Chinese expedition.
							</li>
							<li>
							<strong>1990, June:</strong>
							At the end of June the main group of participants of the forthcoming expedition to Cho-Oyu flew to the Pamir for training ascent to Lenin Peak on the simplest traditional route. July 13: At 18.30 Moscow time, as a result of the earthquake, an avalanche came down from the slope of Lenin Peak and demolished the camp at an altitude of 5,300 meters. The 43 people there were dropped on the icefall and died. The history of world mountaineering did not yet know such a tragedy. Twenty-three people among the dead were from Leonid Troshchinenko's team: 14 from LETI, 4 from the Mining Institute, 3 from the Lokomotiv club. Six, including the expedition leader Alexander Glushkovsky, who were at that time in the lower camp, were still alive. Miraculously escaped and dropped by an avalanche of Alexei Koren.
